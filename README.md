Both the target audience and the sample size is very limited compared with the population, it is difficult to analyze and infer the results.

Even though it is decided to conduct an online survey, it could be implemented using web application such as [LimeSurvey](https://sparkwinn5.limequery.com/)/[SurveyMonkey](https://www.surveymonkey.com/) instead of Google form where it will remove the barrier of limiting only to Gmail users.
